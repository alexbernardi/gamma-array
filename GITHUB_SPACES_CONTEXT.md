# Gamma Array - AI Assistant Context
NO EMOJIIS PLEASE
## Project Summary
Gamma Array is a high-performance VJing application built with C++ and OpenGL, focusing on turntable-style video scratching with DDJ-REV1 controller integration.

## Development Guidelines for AI Assistant

### Working Approach
- Take development one step at a time
- Always verify current file contents before making changes
- Ask for confirmation before making assumptions about system configuration
- Focus on modularity and scalability in all code design
- Avoid making large changes without incremental testing
- Keep code examples minimal and focused on the immediate task

### Current Development Status
- Complete: Project structure, build system, documentation, GitHub repository, dependency setup, core application architecture, MIDI system integration, UI framework with tabbed interface
- Current: DDJ-REV1 MIDI controller fully integrated with real-time signal logging, Adobe-style workspace with four-panel layout, working build system
- Next: Video processing pipeline, audio integration, effects system, MIDI mapping for VJ controls

### Technical Stack
- Platform: Windows 10/11, VS Code, Visual Studio 2022 build tools
- Language: C++17 with modern CMake 3.20+
- Graphics: OpenGL 3.3+ for real-time rendering
- Libraries: GLFW (windowing), ImGui (UI), RtMidi (MIDI), PortAudio (audio)
- Architecture: Modular design with clear separation between core, rendering, audio, MIDI, and UI modules

### Build Commands
```powershell
.\dev.ps1 setup     # Install dependencies and configure build
.\dev.ps1 build     # Build release configuration (due to RtMidi compatibility)
.\dev.ps1 run       # Build and run application with MIDI support
.\dev.ps1 deps      # Check dependency installation status
.\dev.ps1 rebuild   # Clean rebuild when issues occur
```

### Performance Requirements
- 60 FPS video processing minimum
- Audio latency under 10ms
- MIDI input latency under 5ms
- Real-time video scratching capability

### Immediate Development Tasks
1. âœ… Run dependency setup script to install GLFW, ImGui, RtMidi, PortAudio
2. âœ… Create basic Application class structure in src/core/
3. âœ… Implement OpenGL context initialization
4. âœ… Add MIDI device detection for DDJ-REV1
5. âœ… Build basic UI layout system
6. ðŸ”„ Implement video processing pipeline for VJ scratching
7. ðŸ”„ Add audio playback and analysis capabilities
8. ðŸ”„ Create effects processing system
9. ðŸ”„ Map DDJ-REV1 controls to VJ functions

### Important Notes
- Always verify build works after each change
- Use incremental development approach
- Test on actual hardware when MIDI features are added
- Maintain clean modular architecture
- Focus on performance from the beginning
- Do not use emojiis
- After every update lets make a commit and push so we can revert if necessary

This context enables efficient development assistance while maintaining project quality and avoiding over-engineering.
